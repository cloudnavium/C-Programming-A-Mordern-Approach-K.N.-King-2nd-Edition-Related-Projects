# C-Programming-A-Modern-Approach-K.N.-King-2nd-Edition-Related-Projects
For storing the projects, and work that I do while working through the book "C Programming A Mordern Approach, K.N. King, 2nd Edition, Related Projects"

I started working through this book in August 2025. I'm using ChatGPT as my teacher to break things down (which is riduculously helpful for learning), Google, and Youtube Videos. Everything is ordered by chapter, the my chapter folders are pretty unorganized inside though.

My current setup is a Windows 11 Home laptop with WSL and I'm doing all my coding in VIM with TMUX.

These are my personal solutions to practice problems inspired by C Programming: A Modern Approach by K.N. King.
